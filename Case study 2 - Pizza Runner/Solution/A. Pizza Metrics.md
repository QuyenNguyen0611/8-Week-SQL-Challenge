### 3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?
```sql
SELECT runner_id, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS successful_orders
FROM runner_orders_temp 
WHERE cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY runner_id;
```
| runner_id | successful_orders |
|-----------|-------------------|
| 1         | 4                 |

FROM customer_orders_temp c
JOIN pizza_names p ON c.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
WHERE c.order_id IN (
  SELECT order_id

```
| pizza_name | deliver_count |
|------------|----------------|
