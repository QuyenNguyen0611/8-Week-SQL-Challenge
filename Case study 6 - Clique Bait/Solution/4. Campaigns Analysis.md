# Case study 6 - Clique Bait

### 4. Campaigns Analysis 

Generate a table that has 1 single row for every unique visit_id record and has the following columns:

- `user_id`
- `visit_id`
- `visit_start_time`: the earliest event_time for each visit
- `page_views`: count of page views for each visit
- `cart_add`s: count of product cart add events for each visit
- `purchase`: 1/0 flag if a purchase event exists for each visit
- `campaign_name`: map the visit to a campaign if the visit_start_time falls between the start_date and end_date
- `impression`: count of ad impressions for each visit
- `click`: count of ad clicks for each visit

(Optional column) `cart_products`: a comma separated text value with products added to the cart sorted by the order they were added to the cart (hint: use the sequence_number)

```sql
SELECT 
  u.user_id, 
  e.visit_id, 
  MIN(e.event_time) AS visit_start_time, -- finds the earliest event in a visit
  SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS page_views,
  SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cart_adds,
  SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchase,
  c.campaign_name,
  SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 4 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS impression, 
  SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 5 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS click, 
  GROUP_CONCAT(
    CASE 
      WHEN p.product_id IS NOT NULL AND e.event_type = 2 THEN p.page_name 
    END
    ORDER BY e.sequence_number
    SEPARATOR ', '
  ) AS cart_products -- create a comma-separated list of products added to the cart, ordered by sequence_number to preserve the order in which items were added
FROM users AS u
JOIN events AS e
  ON u.cookie_id = e.cookie_id
LEFT JOIN campaign_identifier AS c
  ON e.event_time BETWEEN c.start_date AND c.end_date
LEFT JOIN page_hierarchy AS p
  ON e.page_id = p.page_id
GROUP BY u.user_id, e.visit_id, c.campaign_name;
```
